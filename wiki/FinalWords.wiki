#summary Done!Final notes and info for hook up.
#labels Phase-Support

I hope you enjoyed and learned lots from the wiki pages.

Hopefully now you understand the code that makes the robot do what it does. 

Feel free to change the code to your liking and use it but make sure you follow the license terms.

If you have any questions about the code, feel free to email me at:

I will post pictures of my own robot. All the code I used is available (for the arduino as well as the android and blackberry apps).

I will also post pictures of the hook-up so you get a good idea of how to set the robot up. 

You will find this hook-up diagram in the downloads tab.

==Hook-up==

For the hook-up, the IC (chip connected to the motor pins), is what controls the motors.

As I mentioned before, *DO NOT* simple attach the motors to the arduino you *MUST* use an h-bridge:

==L293D==

Follow the above diagram *BUT* for pins 1 & 9 attach them to the arduino pins 9 & 10.

This is so you can control the motor speeds if you want later on.

Thanks for reading! :D
