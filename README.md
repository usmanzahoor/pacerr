#####Partially Arduino Controled Rover Robot

http://uzahoor10.github.io/pacerr/

***PACERR is an arduino based robot that takes commands from a Bluetooth source and translates them into other messages (motor movements).***

#### Short Description

Pacerr can take commands from any Bluetooth terminal as well as the Blackberry 10 app included in the downloads. The app is just a polished version of the simple bluetoothchat example released by Blackberry themselves. I have also included the code for two possible Android apps you can use. They are in the trunk folder of the source. I have not compiled them and you need to do that on your own. 

I have included the necessary bare basic code for the rover. I will also include several different codes you can apply. You can, by all means, use the codes and build upon them or just use them as is to make your own Pacerr. I will also include files such as .pcb and other schematic for the project as I want to make it as easy as possible to have fun with arduino and BT without going through many hassles. All I ask for is a bit of credit :)
